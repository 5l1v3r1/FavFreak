### Detailed Description about this can be found here : 
// TODO

### Introduction 
I have created this tool for making my work easier when it comes to recon using Favincon hashes, it takes a list of urls (with https or http protocol) from stdin ,then it fetches favicon.ico and calculates its hash value. It sorts the domains/subdomains/IPs according to their favicon hashes and the most interesting part is , It matches calculated favicon hashes with the favicon hashes present in the fingerprint dictionary , If matched then it will show you the results in the output, there is option to generate shodan dorks as well (that is pretty basic and you can do it manually as well)

### How to install and use 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/devanshbatham/FavFreak
$ cd FavFreak
$ virtualenv -p python3 envname
$ source env/bin/activate
$ cat urls.txt | python3 favfreak.py 

```

Example Run : 
``$ cat urls.txt | python3 favfreak.py -o output``
